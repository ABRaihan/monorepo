# Monorepo

This repository serves as a learning space and playground for managing multiple projects and packages in a **monorepo**. It is designed to help me learn the concepts of monorepos, package management, and project structuring. As I build and improve various projects and packages within this repository, I will also practice how to manage shared codebases efficiently.

## Projects and Packages

This monorepo currently contains the following projects and packages. Over time, new packages or projects will be added, and this `README.md` will be updated accordingly.

### 1. [Project/Package Name]

- **Description**: Brief description of what the project or package does.
- **Status**: Work in progress / Complete
- **Technology Stack**: (e.g., React, Node.js, etc.)
- **Installation**: How to install and use the package or project.

### 2. [Project/Package Name]

- **Description**: Brief description of what the project or package does.
- **Status**: Work in progress / Complete
- **Technology Stack**: (e.g., TypeScript, Vite, etc.)
- **Installation**: How to install and use the package or project.

## How to Use This Monorepo

To get started with the projects or packages within this monorepo:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in the root directory to install dependencies for all projects and packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or with yarn
   yarn install


   
## Technologies Used

- **Monorepo Management**: [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/)
- **Package Management**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- **Build System**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Languages and Frameworks**: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js (add others as you use them)

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and add more projects and packages, the following areas will be explored:

- Creating and sharing packages across multiple projects.
- Setting up automated testing and linting across the monorepo.
- Exploring how to handle versioning for packages.
- Deploying monorepo projects efficiently.

This way, you clearly outline the tools and technologies you're using, as well as your future goals and improvements for the repository!
